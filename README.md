# udacity-capstone-stage-1

This project will demonstrate the ability to communicate an app idea formally, using:

- An app description
- UI flow mocks
- A list of required tasks that you will complete to build the app, in order

The Capstone project provides the experience needed to own the full development of an app. 
This first stage replicates the design and planning experience that proficient Android Developers are expected to demonstrate.
